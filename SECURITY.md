# Security Policy

I'm committed to maintaining functionality and security of these utilities.
However, this is a free-time project currently maintained by one person that doesn't know everything. So...

**Use at your own risk!**

While I've done my best to ensure that this functionality is working as intended, I do not recommend using any of this for anything that could risk life, limb, property, or any material harm without extensive, independent security review.
See the [License](LICENSE) for full terms of use.
If you or another party discovers a vulnerability, please see the section below for reporting it.

When the time comes that I am no longer maintaining this repository, either by responding to or resolving functional/security issues, then I will mark it as archived to clearly indicate that it should no longer be used in its current state.
If this repository is archived and you would still like to use it, feel free to fork this repository and update/enhance as you see fit.

## Documentation

I've gone to a great deal of trouble to make sure that the packages available here are documented, both at the package and API level.
This is to ensure that a potential or actual user of this functionality has the details necessary to make well-informed decisions regarding their problem solution fit.
Please do me a solid and read the relevant documentation before reporting an issue.

## Supported Versions

This repository uses a versioning scheme compatible with [Semantic Versioning v2](https://semver.org/).

All latest versions of packages and applications are maintained, and security/functionality updates will be applied from time to time, or as needed if security vulnerabilities are discovered.

### Back-porting fixes

If a security issue is discovered and a fix is applied, then that fix will be applied to the last major version of the package or application where applicable.

Packages or applications with a major version less than 1 are considered pre-release, and should not be used in production.
As such, these versions are not considered for back-porting fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you suspect that a security issue exists, please report it here on GitHub with the functionality in the Security tab, so I can resolve the problem without exposing users to additional risk.
See the [procedure documented here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for details.
If you are a security professional, I can ***always*** use another set of eyes to verify the security and integrity of these utilities. Thank you!
